This application will be implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React Native, Node.js) for a dynamic and user oriented experience. Express.js and Node.js on the back-end permits easy data storage and fetching through custom APIs routes. Additionally, MongoDB and Mongoose allows for a versatile interface with the database by extracting out the complex SQL document-style requirements. React Native serves as the front-end and enables a modular and unidirectional data flow to enhance the speed of our application.
